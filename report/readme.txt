Problem Statement and Research Motivation
In India, where the number of traffic accidents differs significantly between states and union territories also road safety is an important issue for the public. The annual accident statistics are frequently used by officials to assign resources and learn about differences between regions. However, road accident rates are heavily influenced by population size, they might not always accurately reflect the underlying risk. Accident rates per lakh people are used as a supplemental indicator to overcome this restriction. Using multi-year national road accident data, this study investigates whether accident totals and population-adjusted accident rates provide consistent information.
 The Dataset

The dataset  contains road accident  for all Indian states and union territories across the years 2016–2019. It includes total accident counts, accident rates per lakh population, accident rates per 10,000 vehicles, ,percentage contributions to national accident totals, and ranking information. Although multiple years are available, this study we use on the 2019 values for total accidents and accident rate per lakh population, which is suitable for investigating whether absolute accident levels  with population-adjusted risk.
 Research Question

“Is there a correlation between the total number of road accidents and the accident rate per lakh population across Indian states and union territories in 2019?”

 Hypotheses
H₀ (Null Hypothesis):
There is no significant correlation between total road accident counts and accident rates per lakh population in 2019.

H₁ (Alternative Hypothesis):
There is a significant correlation between total road accident counts and accident rates per lakh population in 2019.
 Review of Relevant Research

Research on regional road safety frequently highlights how things like population density, car ownership, infrastructure, and traffic exposure influence accident trends. According to Singh (2020), states with high vehicle volumes tend to report higher accident rates, but these numbers don't always take population variations into consideration. According to Mohan et al. (2017), because per-capita accident rates normalise accident counts across regions of varying sizes, they offer a more accurate picture of underlying risk. Similarly, when comparing regional safety performance, the World Health Organisation (2018) recommends using rate-based indicators because raw totals can produce false conclusions.

Although these studies acknowledge the value of employing both rate-based and absolute measurements, not much research looks at the statistical relationship between the two metrics.Because accident totals and accident rates are regularly published alongside one another in national reports, understanding their relationship is important for interpreting policy documents. This study contributes to this gap by testing the strength of association between accident totals and population-adjusted accident rates.

 Why RQ is of interest
Whenever planning measures, governments frequently give priority to states with high accident rates because they believe that higher totals indicate greater risk. However, a mismatch between accident rates and totals could lead to an inefficient use of resources for road safety. It is possible to directly assess whether accident totals appropriately reflect population-adjusted risk because the dataset offers both indicators for the same year. Determining whether rate-based measures should be prioritised more or whether accident numbers alone can be used by for decision-making is made easier by clarifying this relationship. Additionally, the analysis could direct future studies in state-level comparisons and accident modelling.
